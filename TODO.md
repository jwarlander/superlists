## TODO

-   Make form.save() create a list if not given as arg?
-   Use some kind of hash as URL key to a list, not the id
-   Make it possible to delete lists
-   Allow checking items off

## Done

-   Support more than one list!
-   Display multiple items in the table
-   Code smell: POST test is too long?
-   Donâ€™t save blank items for every request
